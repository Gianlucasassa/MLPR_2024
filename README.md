The folders have those functions:
- Data: input of the models
- Lab_PDF: the PDFs describing the tasks. Each pdf has a "Project" part at the end to be followed for the Report. (PDFs 1 and 6 are useless).
- Models: Contains one folder for each one of the four models: MVG, LR, SVM, GMM.
- Output: should contain the output files of the project.
- Plots: garbage plots that didn't have the 'Output/' path at the beginning and so were sparse around.
- Preprocess: Contains LDa,PCA & general preprocessing.
- load.py and main.py are just code files
- REPORT.txt contains the Link to the Report in google DOC
